## What is Machine Learning?

## Supervised Learning

### Regression

Machine learning is creating tremendous economic value today. I think 99 percent of the economic value created by machine learning today is through one type of machine learning, which is called supervised learning.

Supervised machine learning or more commonly, supervised learning, refers to algorithms that learn x to y or input to output mappings. The key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from. That includes the right answers, whereby right answer, I mean, the correct label y for a given input x, and is by seeing correct pairs of input x and desired output label y that the learning algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label and gives a reasonably accurate prediction or guess of the output.

### Classification

Take breast cancer detection as an example of a classification problem. Say you're building a machine learning system so that doctors can have a diagnostic tool to detect breast cancer. This is important because early detection could potentially save a patient's life. Using a patient's medical records your machine learning system tries to figure out if a tumor that is a lump is malignant meaning cancerous or dangerous. Or if that tumor, that lump is benign, meaning that it's just a lump that isn't cancerous and isn't that dangerous?

## Unsupervised Learning

We're given data that isn't associated with any output labels y, say you're given data on patients and their tumor size and the patient's age. But not whether the tumor was benign or malignant, so the dataset looks like this on the right. We're not asked to diagnose whether the tumor is benign or malignant, because we're not given any labels. Why in the dataset, instead, our job is to find some structure or some pattern or just find something interesting in the data. This is unsupervised learning, we call it unsupervised because we're not trying to supervise the algorithm. To give some quote right answer for every input, instead, we asked the our room to figure out all by yourself what's interesting. Or what patterns or structures that might be in this data, with this particular data set.

### Clustering Algorithm

An unsupervised learning algorithm, might decide that the data can be assigned to two different groups or two different clusters. And so it might decide, that there's one cluster what group over here, and there's another cluster or group over here. This is a particular type of unsupervised learning, called a clustering algorithm.

so to summarize a clustering algorithm. Which is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm, takes data without labels and tries to automatically group them into clusters. And besides clustering, there are other types of unsupervised learning as well. Let's go on to the next video, to take a look at some other types of unsupervised learning algorithms.

### Anomaly Detection

anomaly detection, which is used to detect unusual events. This turns out to be really important for fraud detection in the financial system, where unusual events, unusual transactions could be signs of fraud and for many other applications.

### Dimensionality Reduction

This lets you take a big data-set and almost magically compress it to a much smaller data-set while losing as little information as possible.
